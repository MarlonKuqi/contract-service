Introduction
As an insurance company, we sell our products to individuals and companies. As a
counselor, I want to have an application that allows me to create clients and create contracts
for them. I also want to be able to manage my clients and their contracts.
Your task as a software engineer is to create a backend system that exposes an API that will
interact with clients and contracts.
You are not asked to create the frontend app.
Specifications
Through a Rest API, I would like to be able to:
• Create a client:
o Different type of clients: Person, Company
o Fill their phone, email, name, birthdate (for person), company identifier (for
company) (example: aaa-123).
• Read a client
o Return all the fields of the client.
• Update a client
o Update all the fields, except birthdate and company identifier.
• Delete a client
o When a client is deleted the end date of their contracts should be updated to
the current date.
• Create a contract for a client.
o Contract has a start date (if not provided, set it to the current date) and an end
date (if not provided then put null value).
o Contract cost amount.
o Keep the update date (last modified date) internally, it should not be exposed
in the api.
• Update the cost amount it should automatically update the update date to the current
date.
• Get all the contracts for one client
o It should return only the active contracts (current date < end date)
o Possibility to filter by the update date.
• A very performant endpoint that returns the sum of all the cost amount of the active
contracts (current date < end date) for one client.

Dates should respect the ISO 8601 format.
The API should be RESTful and use JSON format.
Implement validation on the dates, phone number, emails and numbers.



Api Factory – Technical Exercise

Non-Functional requirements
• Code must be implemented using Java and Spring Boot framework.
• You are free to use any database, but the data must persist if the app crashes or
restarts.
• We prefer descriptive code with good naming over comments.
Deliverable
• Ship your code in your GitHub account on a public repository.
• Give us the link to the repository.
• We should be able to run easily your application locally, create a README.md to
explain how to run your application.
• Provide proof or an explanation of why your API works.
• Please provide an explanation (1000 chars max) of your chosen architecture/design
in the README.
• We do not accept any deliverables outside of the Git repository.
Hints
• You are welcome to use any AI tools, Stack overflow, …
• Feel free to improve your code or the functionality if you want to demonstrate some of
your specific knowledges.
• You are welcome to push multiple commits, so we can see your coding flow.
